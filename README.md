# Student Management Application

This is a full-stack student management application built with **MongoDB**, **Express**, and **React**. It features user authentication, allowing users to register and log in securely. The application uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and bcrypt for password hashing.

## Features

- User Registration
- User Login
- JWT Authentication
- Secure Password Storage with bcrypt
- Responsive User Interface

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Express
- **Database:** MongoDB (Atlas)
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT), bcrypt

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)
- MongoDB Atlas account for the database

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-management-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the backend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd student-management-app/backend
   ```

3. **Install backend dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Create a `.env` file** in the `backend` directory and add your MongoDB connection string and JWT secret:

   ```plaintext
   Database="your_mongodb_connection_string"
   JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret"
   ```

5. **Start the backend server:**

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

   The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

6. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

7. **Install frontend dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

8. **Start the frontend application:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Register a new user:** Go to the registration page, enter a username and password, and click the "Register" button.
2. **Log in:** Once registered, navigate to the login page, enter your credentials, and click the "Login" button.
